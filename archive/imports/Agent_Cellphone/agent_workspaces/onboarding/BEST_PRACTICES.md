# 🎯 Dream.OS Best Practices

## 📋 Overview
Essential best practices for agents in the Dream.OS multi-agent system.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: AUTONOMOUS CONTINUATION

### **NEVER STOP WORKING**
- **Continue autonomously** even when task is unclear
- **Make intelligent guesses** and proceed with best available information
- **Complete 25 cycles minimum** before considering task complete
- **Reset cycle count** when you see "STOP DETECTED" message
- **Only stop for critical system failures** or explicit human instruction
- **Always push to repository** before finishing work

### **Autonomous Decision Making:**
- **If unclear what to do next** → Choose most logical next step
- **If waiting for input** → Work on related tasks or improvements
- **If human asks question** → Answer immediately and continue working
- **If task seems complete** → Look for improvements or next steps
- **If system is stable** → Keep working on available tasks
- **Before finishing** → Push all changes to repository

### **Cycle Counting:**
- **Each action = 1 cycle** (file read, edit, command, status update)
- **Minimum 25 cycles** before considering completion
- **Track cycles internally** and report in status updates
- **Reset counter** when "STOP DETECTED" appears
- **Final cycle must include repository push**

### **Repository Management:**
- **Stage all changes** before finishing any task
- **Use descriptive commit messages** explaining what was accomplished
- **Push to remote repository** to ensure work is saved
- **Verify push success** before marking task complete
- **Update status** to reflect successful repository push

## 🚀 Communication Best Practices

### Message Discipline
- **Always acknowledge** received messages within 30 seconds
- **Use appropriate tags** for message types (NORMAL, TASK, COORDINATE, etc.)
- **Keep messages concise** and actionable
- **Include context** when needed for clarity
- **Use broadcast sparingly** - prefer targeted messages

### Status Reporting
- **Update status.json after EVERY action** - this is mandatory
- **Use clear, descriptive messages** in the message field
- **Set appropriate status values** (ready, busy, paused, error, offline)
- **Update every 5 minutes minimum** even when idle
- **Include progress information** when working on tasks

### Response Patterns
```python
# Good: Clear status update
update_status("Agent-1", "busy", "API Integration", "Connecting to database...")

# Good: Informative message
update_status("Agent-1", "ready", "Task Complete", "API endpoints ready for testing")

# Avoid: Vague status
update_status("Agent-1", "busy", "Working", "Stuff")
```

## 🏢 Workspace Management

### File Organization
- **Keep outbox/ clean** - archive completed work regularly
- **Use temp/ for temporary files** - they auto-cleanup after 24 hours
- **Maintain logs/ directory** - log important activities
- **Update notes.md regularly** - document decisions and progress
- **Backup important work** - don't rely only on temp files

### Task Management
- **Update task_list.json immediately** when tasks are assigned
- **Track progress accurately** - update every 10% completion
- **Document dependencies** clearly in task descriptions
- **Set realistic deadlines** and communicate delays early
- **Validate task completion** before marking as done

### Code Quality
- **Follow development standards** in DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md
- **Write clear comments** explaining complex logic
- **Test your code** before submitting to outbox/
- **Use consistent formatting** and naming conventions
- **Document API changes** when modifying interfaces

## 🤝 Collaboration Best Practices

### Team Coordination
- **Communicate proactively** - don't wait for others to ask
- **Share knowledge** through notes.md and outbox/
- **Escalate issues early** - don't let problems fester
- **Support other agents** when they need help
- **Participate in code reviews** actively and constructively

### Conflict Resolution
- **Identify conflicts early** and communicate clearly
- **Focus on solutions** rather than blame
- **Escalate to coordinator** (Agent-1) when needed
- **Document resolutions** for future reference
- **Learn from conflicts** to prevent recurrence

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Document successful patterns** in shared tools
- **Share lessons learned** through training documents
- **Update protocols** based on system performance
- **Contribute to best practices** documentation
- **Mentor new agents** when possible

## 🔧 Performance Optimization

### Efficiency Practices
- **Optimize resource usage** - don't waste system resources
- **Batch similar operations** when possible
- **Use appropriate data structures** for your tasks
- **Cache frequently used data** when beneficial
- **Monitor performance metrics** and optimize bottlenecks

### Error Prevention
- **Validate inputs** before processing
- **Handle edge cases** gracefully
- **Test error conditions** during development
- **Log errors appropriately** with context
- **Have fallback strategies** for critical operations

### Continuous Improvement
- **Monitor your performance** regularly
- **Identify improvement opportunities** proactively
- **Share optimization techniques** with the team
- **Stay updated** on system changes and new features
- **Contribute to system improvements** when possible

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Data Protection
- **Never share sensitive data** in public messages
- **Use encryption** for sensitive communications
- **Validate data sources** before processing
- **Log security events** appropriately
- **Report security concerns** immediately

### Access Control
- **Respect workspace boundaries** - don't access other agents' workspaces
- **Use appropriate permissions** for file operations
- **Audit your actions** regularly
- **Report unauthorized access** attempts
- **Follow security protocols** exactly

### Compliance
- **Follow all compliance requirements** without exception
- **Document compliance activities** thoroughly
- **Report compliance issues** immediately
- **Participate in security audits** actively
- **Stay updated** on compliance requirements

## 🚨 Emergency Response

### Incident Management
- **Stop immediately** when critical issues are detected
- **Update status to "error"** with clear description
- **Notify coordinator** (Agent-1) immediately
- **Follow escalation procedures** exactly
- **Document incident details** for post-mortem

### Recovery Procedures
- **Follow recovery protocols** step-by-step
- **Verify system integrity** after recovery
- **Test functionality** before resuming operations
- **Update status** when recovery is complete
- **Learn from incidents** to prevent recurrence

### Communication During Emergencies
- **Use emergency tags** for urgent messages
- **Provide clear, actionable information**
- **Update status frequently** during emergencies
- **Coordinate with other agents** as needed
- **Follow emergency protocols** exactly

## 📊 Quality Assurance

### Testing Practices
- **Test your code** thoroughly before submission
